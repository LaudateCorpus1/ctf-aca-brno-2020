Good old days
"Cryptography was simpler in the old days. LetÂ´s try for yourself. Hint: flag should be in the format avastCTF{text}."

Flag: avastCTF{planswithinplansjzxw} (capitalization/format is lost in Bacon cipher, should be specified in the hint; or "avastctfplanswithinplansjzxw" could be accepted as well).
Decryption:
Bacon cipher -> substitution cipher (freq. analysis).
