# Overlayed Steganography (Cryptography #4)

## Description
```
We've captured this suspiciously low quality image we have a feeling that something is hidden in it... Maybe another image? The lower bits could have been used to hide it. Try and find out what it is they've hidden from us. Good luck.
```

## Solution
As per the instructions, try to extract the lower bits from the supplied image.
Either make your own tool like `decode.py` or use some tool like `https://incoherency.co.uk/image-steganography/#unhide`.
And copy the flag shown in the image.
