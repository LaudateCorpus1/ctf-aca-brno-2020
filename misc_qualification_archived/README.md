# Archived (Qualification task)

## Description
```
We aquired this file with no extension and we don't know what it is; but it sure does seem important.
```

## Solution

You get an unknown file (like `0`) that has no extension.
When you use the `file` command on it you find it is an archive (7z, bz2, gz, rar, tar, xz or zip).
But when you extract it, there is a similar file inside it.
Now either extract and extract until you find the flag or automate the task as show in `extract.py`
